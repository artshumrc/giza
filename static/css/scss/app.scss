// SCSS/SASS for Digital Giza
// The following modules are used in the Digital Giza site. Note that this was built by Pixels for Humans using Foundation for Sites v6.2.4.
// This was updated in December/January 2021/22 by Martin Uildriks to Foundation v6.7.4 (the latest at that time).
// To build the new css-files configure your development environment to process sass-files. I am currently using VSCode, which has automatic
// sass monitoring built in. To properly build the SASS, the modules below all need to be present in the same folder.
// In VSCode to build new CSS from these SCSS modules one needs to edit and save this file (app.scss), which will trigger a new generation cycle.
// This folder should therefore live inside the css-folder to automatically and quickly generate and update CSS to reflect changes during development.
// Items below have commented out because they are not used in this site. If uncommented this will increase the resulting CSS filesize.

@import 'foundation';
// @import 'motion-ui';                 // THIS WAS PART OF THE ORIGINAL 6.2.4 built, but the module is no longer included.
